# aura-cape

This is a Beaglebone cape designed to interface an ardupilot mega/mini
with a beaglebone linux computer.

Primary design goals:

- Maximizing existing (and inexpensive) well tested hardware.
- Minimize amount of custom electronic circuits.
- Easy assembly/fabrication from kit (mostly 0.1" header soldering.)
- Minimize wiring rats nest by pushing as many connections as possible onto
  the cape.
